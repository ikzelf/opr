03-07-2000 1.0.0 J.M. Spit <jmspit@euronet.nl>
  * idea implemented into this source code.

28-07-2000 1.0.1 J.M. Spit <jmspit@euronet.nl>
  * changed function prototypes so that they are compatible with ANSI C.
  * changed the findEntry function, it does a binary search on the sorted
    list now.

26-09-2000 1.0.2 J.M. Spit <jmspit@euronet.nl>
  * added code to supress character echo while typing passwords.
  * added logging facilities.
  * added export/import functionality.
  * added crosscheck functionality.
26-09-2000 1.0.2 J. Spit   <j.spit@uptime.nl>
  * added code to supress character echo while typing passwords.
  * added a call to chmod to force the access rights -rw------- on the
    repository file.

02-10-2000 1.0.3 J.M.Spit  <jmspit@euronet.nl>
  * the repository file is now platform independent, it stores only 
    string values.
  * changed behaviour of -a option, -a does not ask the password if
    that password is already in the repository.
  * added 'encryption' to the repository. import / export use encrypted
    passwords as well.
    
04-10-2000 1.0.4 J.M.Spit  <jmspit@euronet.nl>
  * changed behaviour of opr -l, now lists everything for the repository owner,
    and lists only the granted entries for other UNIX users.
  * changed -x option, only one entry per <database> <schemaname> is generated
04-10-2000 1.0.4 J. Spit   <j.spit@uptime.nl>
  * removed call to ltoa, replaced with sprintf.
  
06-10-2000 1.0.5 J.M.Spit <jmspit@euronet.nl>
  * removed bug from export / import functions. Could go wrong when the 
    encrypted password contains a whitespace character.
  * removed encryption bug  
  * changed all io on the repository to use fgetc / fputc to avoid 
    possible platform/compiler specific aligning within structures affecting
    the layout of the repository file.

26-10-2000 1.1.0 J.M.Spit <jmspit@euronet.nl>
  * added OCI code, change, verify and crosscheck passwords on 
    database.

12-01-2001 1.1.1 J.M.Spit <jmspit@euronet.nl>
  * due to a SUNOS specific bug (Sun calls it a feature), we had to split the
    opr into HPUX and SunOS specific distributions. For HPUX, nothing changed 
    but the version number in 1.1.1.

04-06-2004 1.1.4 J.Spit <j.spit@uptime.nl>
  * now works with 64 bit Oracle installations (will try 32 bit lib first, then
    the 64 bit lib)
  * database name is automatically converted to uppercase, schema & osuser to
    lowercase.

15-07-2004 1.1.5 J.Spit <j.spit@uptime.nl>
  * ability to add SYS passwords to OPR.

08-05-2005 1.1.6 J.M.Spit <jmspit@euronet.nl>
  * improved the documentation.
  * changed cosmetics of output.
  * improved database check and change functions; obtained handles are
    explicitly freed, connected session is explicitly disconnected.
  * added call to dlclose matching the dlopen on SOLARIS
  * changed all calls to strcmp to strncmp (assuming all unices support it 
    by now)

15-06-2005 1.1.7 J.Spit <j.spit@uptime.nl>
  * Oracle client libraries are now dynamicly opened/closed only for those 
    operations that require them. This goes for all platforms. This means you 
    can use OPR on systems without an Oracle installation to e.g. list, retrieve
    and delete passwords from the repository. 
  * added -f flag to forcibly add a password entry without verification on the
    database.
  * bugfix: ocisessionend function was not initialized.
  * bugfix: when retrieving a password, schemaname was case sensitive.
  * currently database is converted to uppercase, and schemaname to lowercase. 
    OSuser is left untouched.
  * raised max. repository entries from 1024 to 4096
  * minor cosmetic changes
17-06-2005 1.1.7 J.M.Spit <jmspit@euronet.nl>
  * Removed possible buffer overflow in askPassword.
  
29-06-2005 1.1.8 J.M.Spit <jmspit@euronet.nl>
  * the dlopen scheme based on the ORACLE_HOME environment var was vulnerable to
    a malicious libclnstsh.so attack. opr now only loads a libclntsh.so lib that
    is located in the default (*:) ORACLE_HOME/lib32 or ORACLE_HOME/lib listed 
    in the machine's oratab.
    
30-11-2005 1.1.9 J.M.Spit <jmspit@euronet.nl>
  * The INSTALL file informed that you need to be able to see the oracle oci 
    libraries, but it fact you need these only at runtime. You do need access
    to the OCI headers files during runtime though. But these rights are enabled
    by default oracle installations.
  * opr now uses libltdl, a dynamic loading abstraction, to tackle compiling
    issues on (for example) hp-ux.
  * added file locking on the repository file.
  * fixed 2 strncat invocation bugs.

20-03-2006 1.1.10 J.M.Spit <jmspit@euronet.nl>
  * switched from lockf to fcntl file locking calls for better platform 
    independence.

26-07-2006 1.1.11 J.M.Spit <jmspit@euronet.nl>
  * minimal change to prevent compile error with older versions of gcc

24-02-2009 1.1.11-1 Sergey Kryazhevskikh <soliverr@gmail.com>
  * check ORACLE_HOME before read oratab.
  * set default location for password repository: ./configure --with-oprreposdir=<path>.

14-05-2013 1.1.12 J.M.Spit <jmspit@euronet.nl>
  * added checks for inclusion of librt (or posix4) on Solaris for nanosleep
  * updated autoconf to recognize modern linux systems
  * fixed autoconf issues with libtdl

12-09-2013 1.1.12-1 Sergey Kryazhevskikh <soliverr@gmail.com>
  * Incorporate changes from 1.1.11-1 to 1.1.12.
